## Translate

You may provide translations for the application to see it running in your own language. Please follow these steps:

Let's say, we're adding French (`fr`) translation.

1. Fork the repository & navigate [here](https://github.com/bluecherrydvr/unity/tree/main/lib/l10n).
2. Create a new file named `app_fr.arb`.
3. Add your translations to your new `app_fr.arb` file in correspondence to existing [English translations](https://github.com/bluecherrydvr/unity/tree/main/lib/l10n/app_en.arb).
4. Send us a new pull-request. ðŸŽ‰

## Bug-Reports

Send us details about any issues you discover [in the issues](https://github.com/bluecherrydvr/unity/issues) or [in the forums](https://forums.bluecherrydvr.com/).

## Contribute

The code uses [Provider](https://github.com/rrousselGit/provider) for state-management because it is widely known by Flutter community, doesn't bring any unnecessary complexity to the codebase & is scalable/stable enough.

Most `ChangeNotifier`s are available as singletons, though de-coupled from each other. This is important to handle things like loading app configuration before `runApp`, handling background notification button actions & few other asynchronous operations performed outside the widget tree. By having singletons, we are able to avoid a strict dependency on the `BuildContext` & do certain things in a more performant way.

Everything is well-documented (e.g. [this](https://github.com/bluecherrydvr/unity/blob/fce2aad3213298f70e91eb549a71699826e5c6e4/lib/providers/mobile_view_provider.dart#L28-L35)). Other important comments & work-arounds may be found throughout the code.
